              <p class="card-text">With the automotive industry shifting towards electric vehicles and increasing climate change concerns, we developed an all-electric vehicle - BOLT in 2015 and participated in FSAE Australasia, held in Melbourne (Australia). The long-term aim of the team was to advance the technology of electric vehicles so that they may become cheaper and more efficient compared to gasoline-powered conventional cars. The car design was finalized after rigorous simulation and analysis of mechanical and electrical systems using software like Ansys, SolidWorks, ADAMS, MATLAB, Lapsim, and Multisim. After all this hard work and patience, the team finally got its reward, the number one Indian team in the Formula Student electric rankings.</p>
